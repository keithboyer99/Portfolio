        "I do not distress the insides of my boxes and ALL the pieces I make are engraved or signed with my name and date on both the back and inside where it cannot be possibly removed. It is never my intention for my pieces to be sold or resold as an actual antique, but rather provide an opportunity to own a piece of history that may not be available or affordable otherwise.", 
        "Because of my unique antiquing techniques that may include water based materials and applied dirt and grime, a feather duster should only be used on my pieces in your housekeeping duties."
